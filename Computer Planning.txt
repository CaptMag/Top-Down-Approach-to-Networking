List of things I want to learn / create (based on priority)

1.) Learn more networking as well as Programming (Mostly Python and Bash scripting)
  - My reason to learn this is to be more familiar with networking and programming terminology and commands, I also want to
learn how to create my own scripts and automations.

2.) Finish setting up VMware ESXI
  - the webui is working however, the VMs still do not have access to the internet, I will need to find a way to solve this

3.) Ethical Hacking
  - Found a few books and helpful tutorials I want to try out, specifically OfSec material

4.) want to create some sort of personal project (automation or just learning about a specific topic such as malware and how
it is created)
